# Simon Tinsley

## üëã Intro
Hi - I'm Simon, a software developer who has recently made the leap into pursuing this as a career full-time. I spent the last 5 years working at startups in Growth. Having taught myself HTML, CSS, jQuery and SQL in those roles - as we were always short of engineers! - I found the time I was spending coding was the part of the job I was enjoying the most.

I took the plunge and joined Makers Academy for a 16-week bootcamp, learning key concepts and establishing a solid develop process, and I'm now looking for my first full-time role as a software engineer.

* JavaScript (React, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress, Koa)

## ü§ì Skills

### Fast Learner
Throughout my career I have jumped in at the deep end, and had to learn new skills from scratch. I was a full-time teacher after 6 weeks of training, and the only person in the growth team at ClickMechanic with no experience. Whilst at ClickMechanic, I taught myself SQL & ran the business intelligence function, and also learned how to run a product process.

I find the challenge of learning something new exhilirating, and thrive on the challenge of learning in an unfamiliar environment. I found this particularly stimulating at Makers Academy, where much of the learning was self-directed, and the skills I had built up over the course of my career enabled me to grasp new concepts quickly and help explain them to others in my cohort.


### Good Communicator
Working in the product process in multiple companies has demanded good communication. I have worked with multiple stakeholders across the businesses, to ensure correct prioritisation, and the impact on each of the teams. I have extensive experience working with engineers to ensure the requirements are clear and to understand the technical limitations and challenges in any ticket, so that I can design it to minimise development time.

Whilst teaching, I had to ensure the concepts were explained clearly & understood by pupils. Similarly, Makers Academy demanded clear communication to help navigate my partner during pair programming, ensuring that they understood the concepts being taught, and during debugging our code.


### Problem Solving
Working in growth at various startups has demanded a diverse set of problem solving skills. When re-designing the pricing system at ClickMechanic (a 2-sided marketplace for car repair), it required predicting behaviour on both the customer & mechanic sides, messaging any changes delicately to mechanics and adjusting the design according to engineering requirements.

I particularly enjoy problem solving while coding, where it demands precisely understanding the requirements & logic. Likewise, it is particularly helpful in debugging, where a methological approach saved me countless hours during the course.
